	<h2>Grillenberg</h2>
	<p class="start">The village is around 9 kilometres north of Sangerhausen on the edge of the Harz mountains. Since 27 November 2006 Grillenberg has borne the title "state-recognised resort".</p>
	<p>Grillenberg was probably first recorded in the register of the tithes of Hersfeld Abbey dating to between 881 and 899, as the tithe-owing village of 'Coriledorpf'. In 1147 the Grilleberg Castle estate (Burgamt Grillenberg) appears as part of the old Barony of Sangerhausen. The estate was detached and given to the Thuringian count, Lambertius (of Gleichen), who called himself comes de Monte ("count of the hill"). The owners and managers of the castle estate changed hands. In 1361, the castle, estate and village were seized in a feud by the Count of Mansfeld. In 1362 he had to return it again. The farmers of the village had all taxes and services waived for three years because, during the siege of the castle they had suffered much damage. In 1430 22 deserted villages were mentioned that belonged to the castle estate. In 1525, management of the castle estate moved to Sangerhausen. The last occupant of the castle in 1683 was the Royal Forester and Armourer (KÃ¶nigliche Forst- und Zeugknecht), Hans Lehmann.</p>
